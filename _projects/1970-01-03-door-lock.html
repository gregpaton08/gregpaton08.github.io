  <h2>
    Problem
  </h2>
  <p>Keys are the worst. Taking up at that valuable pocket space. Incessantly jingling. Ugh. It's the 21st century. Why must we endure this suffering?! Maybe we no longer have to...</p>

  <h2>
    Solution
  </h2>
  <p>Introducing Home Lock. Why use keys when you can unlock your house with your phone? Take back that lost pockets space. Rejoice! Now if only I could start my car with my phone...</p>

  <h2>
    Hardware
  </h2>
  <p>
    The hardware consists of off the shelf parts with some minor modifications. The lock itself is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MiLocks-DF-02SN-Electronic-Touchpad-Deadbolt/dp/B00NONIKPC" target="_blank">MiLocks DF-02SN deadbolt</a>. The lock is controlled using a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> which exposes control via a REST API.
