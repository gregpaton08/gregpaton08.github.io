  <h2>
    Problem
  </h2>
  <p>Keys are the worst. Taking up at that valuable pocket space. Incessantly jingling. Ugh. It's the 21st century. Why must we endure this suffering?! Maybe we no longer have to...</p>

  <h2>
    Solution
  </h2>
  <p>Introducing Home Lock. Why use keys when you can unlock your house with your phone? Take back that lost pocket space. Rejoice! Now if only I could start my car with my phone...</p>

  <h2>
    Hardware
  </h2>
  <div>
  <p>
    The hardware consists of off the shelf parts with some minor modifications. The lock itself is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BK9K5LS/ref=psdc_511306_t3_B00NONIKPC" target="_blank">MiLocks QF-02SN deadbolt</a>. The lock is controlled using a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> which exposes control via a REST API.

    iPhone App
  </h2>
  <p>
    What's the use of all this fancy hardware if there's no way to easily control it? So, I wrote a simple iPhone app to take care of that. No explanation necessary, just check out the video below.
