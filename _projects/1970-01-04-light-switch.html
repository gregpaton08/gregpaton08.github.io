  <h2>
    Problem
  </h2>
  <p>
    Ever been laying in bed and realize you forgot to turn the light off? Well I have. Apparently one to many times because I chose to take matters into my own hands...
  </p>

  <h2>
    Solution
  </h2>
  <p>
    I was wandering through Target one day and came across a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Westinghouse-28068-Indoor-2-outlet-Remote/dp/B00I7B9KIM" target="_blank">remote controlled outlet</a> sitting in a clearance bin. Huzzah! My problems were solved. I could control my pesky light with a remote. But why stop there? Why not control it from my phone, through the web?
  </p>

  <h2>
    Hardware
  </h2>
  <p>
    The hardware is a slightly modified <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Westinghouse-28068-Indoor-2-outlet-Remote/dp/B00I7B9KIM" target="_blank">Westinghouse 28068 Indoor 2-outlet Remote</a> that I picked up for cheap on a post-Christmas sale. The unit consists of a box that sits between the lamp's power cord and the wallet outlet along with a remote to control it. The portion that plugs into the wall was left as is. The remote was ripped apart, a few resistors and transistors were added, and now it's controlled using a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> which exposes control via a REST API and a (painfully) basic web page that I can access on my local network.
