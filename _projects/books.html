  <h1>Books</h1>

  <p>This isn't really a project, at least not in the traditional sense that I think of projects. However, I thought someone might find value in this, and I could use it as a reference for myself. This is a growing document of books I've read and that I feel you should, or shouldn't read. Enjoy! If you'd like to discuss any of them, I'd love to <a href="/contact">hear from you</a>.</p>
