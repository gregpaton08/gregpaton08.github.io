    Problem
  </h2>
  <p>
    Ever wonder what the temperature was inside your house versus outside your house? I wondered all the time. Should I have my window fan on? Which way should it blow, in or out? So, I created a simple app to feed me that info.

    Solution

  <p>
    <a href="https://murmuring-caverns-91180.herokuapp.com/">Weather Station</a> gives me the simple data that I need with no distractions. Plus, I can access it from anywhere and see what the temperature inside my house is currently sitting at.
