    Build
  </h2>
  <p>
    My name is Greg and I like to build things. What kinds of things? Software, houses, sandcastles... anything really. I love to build, and the common denominator has always been beauty: beauty in design, beauty in construction, beauty in purpose.

    Purpose

  <p>
    I take pride in everything I build. Just as importantly, what I build needs purpose. That could mean many things: solving a problem, helping a stranger, putting a smile on your face. Whatever it may be, purpose is fundamental. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all.
