    Build
  </h2>
  <p>
    My name is Greg and I like to build things. What kinds of things? Software, houses, sandcastles... anything really. I love to build, and the common theme has always been beauty: beauty in design, beauty in construction, beauty in purpose.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Design
  </h2>
  <p>
    You can't get far without a plan. I learned (and am still learning...) that the hard way. You need to know <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link alice.html %}">where you're going</a> and determine the best way to get there, and you need to start with beauty. If you start with beauty you'll end with beauty.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Construction
  </h2>
  <p>
    The fun part. We all love diving into a project and getting our hands dirty. Construction is opportunity to create somthing out of nothing, to add beauty to the world where it previously did not exist. I see what I build as a reflection of myself and who I am in that moment, and I strive for that to be the best it possibly can.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Purpose
  </h2>
  <p>
    What I build needs purpose. That could mean many things: solving a problem, helping a stranger, putting a smile on your face. Whatever it may be, purpose is fundamental. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all.
