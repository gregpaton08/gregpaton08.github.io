I keep telling myself I need to write more and actually publish it somewhere, even if it is just to my own site that few, if any, people visit. So here it is, on a rainy Saturday morning, a break in an over five year hiatus from blogging. Hopefully this is the start of a new trend and not the beginning of another half-decade break. We shall see.
