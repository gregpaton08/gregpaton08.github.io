  I read a lot last year, and plan to do the same in 2019. To share what I've found, I'm going to post reviews of the books I've read. The format is simple. Books will be rated as "READ IT" or "SKIP IT" followed by my thoughts on why. The goal for this year is 36 books. Hopefully this will keep me accountable, and maybe inspire others to read more. Time will tell.
