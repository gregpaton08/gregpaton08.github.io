    Alice: Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?<br>
    Cheshire Cat: That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.<br>
    Alice: I don't much care where.<br>
    Cheshire Cat: Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.<br>
    Alice: ...So long as I get somewhere.<br>
    Cheshire Cat: Oh, you're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough.
